# Dependencies between projects known to clbuild.  If a
# project is not listed in this file, it can still be
# downloaded, but a warning will be issued.
#
# THIS FILE IS AUTOGENERATED.  Feel free to edit it if you
# must, but never commit a hand-written version.  Use
# "clbuild record-dependencies" to recompute the official
# version.  Doing so requires a complete check out,
# including wnpp projects.  Please look out for unintended
# changes due to local configuration issues before
# committing
#
# Quick dependency FAQ:
#
# This file is an educated guess and sometimes not perfect.
# We prefer to err on the side of too many dependencies
# rather than too few.
#
# However, the following situations are NOT necessarily bugs:
#   - circular dependencies
#     (cffi depends on trivial-features, which depends on
#     cffi itself.  That is NOT a problem.
#   - non-transitive dependencies
#     (if A depends on B, which depends on C, it does NOT
#     follow that A depends on C.)
#
